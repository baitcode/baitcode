## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm contributing to various projects in the Starknet and TON ecosystems. My main interests lie in DevOps for protocol engineering, blockchain research, and ZKP technologies for decentralized computationâ€”particularly in connection with the gaming industry.

Currently, I'm looking for work as a blockchain engineer or protocol engineer.

Iâ€™m a mathematician (5 years of university training) and a generalist software engineer with over 15 years of experience.

I'm well-skilled on the frontend with React and have experience building games and Chrome extensions in JavaScript. Most of my career has been in backend development, which I believe speaks for itself.

I speak: Python, Kotlin, Golang, Cairo, TypeScript, and a bit of Solidity and Rust.

I was laid off a while ago and am open to collaboration opportunities.
