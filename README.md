## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm contributing to various projects in the Starknet and TON ecosystem. My main interests lie in DevOps for protocol engineering, blockchain research, ZKP technologies for decentralised computation in connection to the gaming industry.

Currently I'm looking for work as a blockchain engineer or protocol engineer.

I am a mathematician (5 years university training) and generalist software engineer (>15 years of experience).

I've been laid off a while age and open to collaboration opportunities.
